This ZIO unittest is made with Python Unittest. It performs tests on buffer,
triggers and devices. This unittest depends on PyZio library that you can find
on GitHub (https://github.com/FedericoVaga/PyZio).

RULES:
1.0 Test specific feature.
    Do not waste time with paranoic tests, or re-testing the same stuff in
    different tests. Trust the other tests, they will fail on error. So,
    concentrate only to the feature object of test.
    
1.1 Create a class for each kind of test.
    Class should contain few tests about a specific feature

2.0 Keep It Simple Stupid, KISS.
    Use very simple algorithm to create your tests. This should reduce the
    number of errors that you will do. We do not want bug in the test suite,
    if possibile :)

2.1 Avoid big function.
    Big function are not simple, split them into smaller function that perform
    simple task.

3.0 Style Rules
3.1 Describe the feature to test under the class declaration
3.2 Describe the specific test purpose under the function declaration.
3.3 Leave two blank lines between two functions
